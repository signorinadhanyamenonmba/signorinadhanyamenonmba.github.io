### Know Me

I'm a writer specialising in banking, capital markets and global economic affairs. I interest myself in breaking news articles, investment research and thought leadership that drives my audience to action. I'm devoted to explaining and documenting to the extent that I like not only to direct my readers to the right financial decision but also in enabling them to arrive at one. So, I frequently spend time writing code for open source projects. And part as I do never with my typepad, when not storytelling with events or data, I put to print narratives for everything from drama to games not leaving my niche of finance.
