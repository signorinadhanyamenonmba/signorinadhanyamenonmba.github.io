### Know Me

I'm a data scientist in the fintech ecosystem specialising in banking, capital markets and global economic affairs. I interest myself in breaking news, investment research and thought leadership that drives action. When not storytelling with theories, events or data, I can be found brainstorming for ideas for everything from web novels to games not leaving my niche of finance. 

### Read Me

At work, at [Mint Street to Dalal Street](https://mintstreettodalalstreet.wordpress.com/), I curate all the hot happenings in business and investing, making a journey through the maze of market data easier via insightful feeds of news that hits the markets hard, available also on [Google News](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKML7MqQswsNfBAw?ceid=IN:en). And later when I sign off, I stay back at [The Desk of The Data Scientist](https://thedeskofthedatascientist.wordpress.com) to volunteer for organising knowledge, promoting ample use of data to reduce costs, optimise returns and mitigate risks and making available exhaustive open resources to make sense of financial information.
