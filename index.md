### Know Me

I'm a data scientist in the fintech ecosystem specialising in banking, capital markets and global economic affairs. I interest myself in breaking news, investment research and thought leadership that drives my clients to action. When not storytelling with theories, events or data, I can be found brainstorming for ideas for everything from web novels to games not leaving my niche of finance.
