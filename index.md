### Know Me

I'm a data scientist in the fintech ecosystem specialising in banking, capital markets and global economic affairs. I interest myself in breaking news, investment research and thought leadership that drives action. When not storytelling with theories, events or data, I can be found brainstorming for ideas for everything from web novels to games not leaving my niche of finance.

Before getting down to hard nosed, heads down disciplined work to digitise the investment process from a combination of spreadsheets and manual workflows to state of the art cloud based artificially intelligent decision models based on real time data on assets at [Mint Street to Dalal Street](https://sites.google.com/view/mintstreettodalalstreet), I curate all the hot happenings in business and investing and share on [Google News](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKML7MqQswsNfBAw?ceid=IN:en) insightful feeds that would lend meaning to the journey through the maze of market data. And later when I sign off, I stay back to volunteer for organising research knowledge and documenting the use of data science in making sense of financial information that I make available on [LinkedIn Pulse](https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/mint-street-to-dalal-street).
